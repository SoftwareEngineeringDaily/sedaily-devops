# SEDaily Event Stream Processor

The real time event processing infrastructure gateway server is responsible for authenticating connecting clients and validating event  payload schemas before putting the event on the SED event bus.

## Set up (local)
  - `npm install`
  - `cp .env.local_example .env`
  - Set the KAFKA_HOST to the docker ip address. Usually localhost or 192.168.99.100
  - `docker-compose up -d`
  - The docker-compose.yml file is configured to create several topics at container creation time

## Usage
  - Running `npm start` will start the API server on localhost:3000
  - Run `npm run test`
    
## Authentication
	- Authenticate requests by sending an express-jwt token generated by the [SEDaily API](https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/software-engineering-daily-api). The JWT_SECRET variable in the .env file must match the SEDaily API JWT_SECRET variable in the .env file in order to authenticate.
